## Introduction

Regardless of the context and rationale, running distributed applications on geographically dispersed IT resources often comes with various technical and organizational challenges. If not addressed appropriately, these challenges may impede development, and in turn, scientific and business innovation. We have designed and developed Brane to support implementers in addressing these challenges. Brane makes use of containerization to encapsulate functionalities as portable building blocks. Through programmability, application orchestration can be expressed using intuitive domain-specific languages. As a result, end-users with limited or no programming experience are empowered to compose applications by themselves, without having to deal with the underlying technical details.

See the [documentation](https://wiki.enablingpersonalizedinterventions.nl) for more information.
