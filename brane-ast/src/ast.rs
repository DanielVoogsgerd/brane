//  Description:
//!   Defines the `brane-ast`  AST, which is defined as an acyclic* graph
//!   where the nodes are external, orchestratable and policy-sensitive
//!   tasks (e.g., compute tasks or transfer tasks), and the edges are
//!   'control flow' that are small pieces of BraneScript that decide
//!   which task to compute next. Can be thought of as a graph with
//!   intelligent edges.
